# User evaluation for `output/2026-02-19_room-selection-list-vs-grid_BRIDGE.html`

## Overall

- The report is well-structured and easy to read.
- The use of colors and formatting makes it visually appealing.
- The content is relevant to the user's query.
- The report is self-contained and easy to share.
- As new reports are generated, we need a better naming convention so they do not overwrite each other. I want each report to be individually identifiable and shareable.

## Research

- Although I saw best practices mentioned in the report, I did not see any external links to articles, competitors, or other resources that were used to generate the report. I would like to see these links in the report so that I can verify the information and learn more about the topic. This goes for both the pro and con side of the report.
- Research should be more quantifiable. Without additional references, this report is just a collection of opinions which can be subjectively challenged. For example, the report mentions that "users are looking for a more intuitive and user-friendly interface". This is a subjective statement that cannot be verified without additional research at a macro level. I would expect you to cite sources for your claims. DO NOT MAKE UP FACTS. DO NOT FABRICATE INFORMATION.

## Quotes

- Good use of quotes, however you only quoted from my input. I would like to see quotes from external sources.

## Final Recommendation

- Loved the mitigation strategy.
