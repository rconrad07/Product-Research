# User evaluation for `output/verified_loyalty_analysis_report.html`

## Overall

- URL deeplinks remain the single biggest issue with the report
- Also don't need references to "citations checked & deep-linked" and "Verbatim Quote Verification". If things are working as expected, these should be implicit.

## URL Citations

- 2 of the 6 deeplinks worked, the rest were 404s. This is unacceptable.
- Reference the following for more information on how to potentially fix this issue: <https://www.cennest.com/fix-geminis-broken-citations-with-groundcite-complete-guide/>. Do not let your solution conflict with other instructions in the Product Research Agent.
