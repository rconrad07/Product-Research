# User evaluation for `output/gated_search_analysis_report.html`

## Overall

- "Build MVP" feels like it expresses the right level of commitment
- External references boosted the credibility of the report, however there are issues with the URLs (described below)
- Good use of metrics to support or refute the original hypothesis. This also builds the credibility of the report.
- The skeptic is doing a phenominal job of providing a contarian perspective on the hypothesis and presenting evidence to support its position
- The brief summary at the bottom of the pro/con sections is a great addition. It helps to quickly summarize the key points of each section.

## URL Citations

- Url's did not link to the article they were referencing but rather a generic url (e.g. homepage of a website rather than the article within the site). Ensure every citation link uses the article-specific deep-link. 404s or homepages are unacceptable.
- A valid citation link MUST:
  - Resolve directly to the referenced article or source page
  - Not redirect to a homepage, search page, category page, or login wall
  - Not return an error page (404, 403, expired, or placeholder content)
- Never fabricate URLs.
- Never guess URL structures.
- Never use shortened links, tracking links, or generic domain homepages.

## Other Comments

- The SEO comments were a great addition since this was originally overlooked. I think it would not be a leap to also consider GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) targeting as a factor in the analysis.
- After I submit my hypothesis, I don't feel 100% confident that the LLM agent is running through the agentic workflow as it was constructed to do so. This could be because I'm used to invoking an orchestrator agent, which was not incorporated into this LLM. I'm curious if there is a better/perferred method for initiating an E2E run?
