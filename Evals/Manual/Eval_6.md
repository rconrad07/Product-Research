# User evaluation for `output/verified_loyalty_analysis_report.html`

## Overall

- URL deeplinks STILL did not work. This is unacceptable.
- This version not only failed to fix the URL deeplink issue, it also removed the the depth and insight of the prior report by 90%.

## URL Citations

- If we cannot fix the URL deeplink issue, we should KEEP the links in the report but explicitly denote the links as unverified in order to prioritize context and insights. User's can perform their own external research when necessary. However, we should be doing everything within our power to fix this issue and ensure that all the links provided in the report are valid and working.
